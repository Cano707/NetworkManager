# NetworkManager

This project is the result of a practical module during my studies. It implements a backend service that enables the user to configure network devices - only Cisco Routers and Switches are supported at the moment - and manage them from a centralized device.

It is no longer maintained.

# Usage

The service starts a local http server on port 8080.

The following command should be run from the root directory

```bash
python -m app.main
```
